v0.2 Contributors Tomas Sieger, Wolf-Julian Neumann, Gerd Tinkhauser
This is an open research tool that is not intended for clinical purposes. 

# What's new?

Tomas Sieger has added support for unilateral implants!
I have written some code for artefact detection and cleaning that is automatically run on all BrainSense TimeDomain signals. 

# INPUT

## files:
All input is optional, you can specify files as cell or character array
(e.g. files = 'Report_Json_Session_Report_20200115T123657.json') 
if files isn't specified or remains empty, it will automatically include
all files in the current working directory
if no files in the current working directory are found, a you can choose
files via the MATLAB uigetdir window.

## subjectIDs:
you can specify a subject ID for each file in case you want to follow an
IRB approved naming scheme for file export e.g. run perceive('Report_Json_Session_Report_20200115T123657.json','Charite_sub-001')
if unspecified or left empy, the subjectID will be created from
ImplantDate, first letter of disease type and target (e.g. sub-2020110DGpi)


## OUTPUT

The script generates BIDS bids.neuroimaging.io/ inspired subject and session folders with the
ieeg format specifier. 
All time series data are being exported as FieldTrip '.mat' files, as these require no additional dependencies for creation.
You can reformat with FieldTrip and SPM to MNE python and other formats (e.g. using fieldtrip2fiff([fullname '.fif'],data))

# Recording type output naming
Each of the FieldTrip data files correspond to a specific aspect of the Recording session: 
LMTD = LFP Montage Time Domain - BrainSenseSurvey
IS = Indefinite Streaming - BrainSenseStreaming
CT = Calibration Testing - Calibration Tests
BSL = BrainSense LFP (2 Hz power average + stimulation settings)
BSTD = BrainSense Time Domain (250 Hz raw data corresponding to the BSL file)

## TODO: 
ADD BATTERY DRAIN information per sesssion
ADD BSL data to BSTD ephys file
ADD PATIENT SNAPSHOT EVENT READINGS
ADD CHRONIC DIAGNOSTIC READINGS
ADD Lead DBS Integration for electrode location
